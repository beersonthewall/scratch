** What's This?

Data analysis of my first coffee roasts. TLDR I plot some curves.

*** Conventions

- The first datapoint at time 0:00 will use the ambient temperature since the SR 800 does not display a temp and simply says (Lo) for the first few seconds of a roast.
- All data points are taken by hand on a notepad, thus there is _significant_ measurment error.
- Temperatures are from the SR 800 and the actual bean temperatures are likely significantly lower. The reading is consistent which helps reproducability, it's just not the actual bean temp.
- Temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit 
- Times formatted as minutes:seconds
